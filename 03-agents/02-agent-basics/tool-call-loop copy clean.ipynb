      "3. **Ecology and Behavior**: They are semiaquatic and are excellent swimmers, capable of holding their breath underwater for up to five minutes. Their diet mainly comprises grasses and aquatic plants, and they practice coprophagy to extract maximum nutrients from their food.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Social Structure**: Capybaras are often gregarious, living in groups that typically consist of several adult males, females, and juveniles. They exhibit complex social behaviors and use various vocalizations for communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Conservation**: Currently, capybaras are not considered endangered, although they face threats from hunting and habitat destruction in some areas. They are farmed for meat and skin in parts of South America, especially during Lent in Venezuela.\n",
